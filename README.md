Small Javascript LangtonAnt's project with custom CSS i made during my boring javascript classes for fun.

To start the script, open your browser's console and type : ```js main(speed)``` With "speed" being a little counterintuitive because it's the number of steps taken every... step.. Bigger means faster.

Works better on Chromium based browsers because of css animations for some reason.


From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Langton's ant is a two-dimensional universal Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior.

It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells.

The universality of Langton's ant was proven in 2000. The idea has been generalized in several different ways, such as turmites which add more colors and more states.
